# Rails templates for custom needs

## Bootstrapped.rb

Contains automations to bootstrap a rails project with a cleaned up gemfile, rspec configured, debugging gems and
bootstrap css and js already configured. It also arranges default folder structure to use Sass and modular imports for components.

My main pain point was that I really like to start new projects and the hardest part is the beginning where I spend hours just configuring my gems and test configurations.
This project saves me time by getting everything ready to start building what really matters.
